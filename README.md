# GiphyGame

This website allows users to enter anything they like into a textbox, (i went with a theme)  and then have that text turned into a clickable button. Clicking the button will search giphy for (seemingly) related gifs to the search terms and generate 10 gifs. Click the images to start and stop the gif animations.
